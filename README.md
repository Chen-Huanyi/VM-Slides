A template for making presentation slides in
[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).

Latex can look daunting at first, but it is actually be quite easy. This
template takes care of the boilerplate code so that you can focus on content.
Start by adding content and then looking up LaTex symbols as you need them.

## Usage:

* Write content to `slides.tex`. Instructions are in the file.
* Run `make` to render the PDF.

## Dependencies:

1. LaTeX (TeX Live)
2. git
3. GNU make
4. rubber

## Resources

* [LaTeX Wiki Book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)

  LateX](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf)
